## 🔍 Key Insights

- Sales and Operations departments showed high attrition and low satisfaction.
- Female attrition was notably higher in some departments.
- R&D and Finance showed stability and strong engagement.
- Junior roles had the highest turnover due to lack of growth or external offers.
- Attrition increases slightly post year-end, possibly linked to review/bonus cycles.

## ✅ Recommendations

1. Improve job satisfaction through recognition and feedback.
2. Investigate and adjust department-level salary gaps.
3. Reduce excessive overtime to avoid burnout.
4. Support junior employees with career development programs.
5. Increase job involvement through team-building and mentorship initiatives.

## ⚠️ Limitations

The dataset did not include time-based fields like `JoiningDate` or `ExitDate`, so a line chart for attrition trends over time could not be created. All other requirements were met using the available data.
